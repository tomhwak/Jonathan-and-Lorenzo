             <p> <strong> The North side was against slavery with the favor of president Abraham Lincoln and congress they make up all the Nothern
                 states such as Maine,New Jesrsey and much more. The North had the higher advangtage over the south in supplies, weaponry, 
                and training however te South was not to be messed with although almost the North side had all the advantage the south had more 
                plain areas; or farm aland than the South. Eventhough the  Civil War is between the North and the Suoth some of te North East states
                where woring with the North providing the backbone for the North side of the war. The North side was also nickname the Union as i mentioned earlier
                they where against slavery, however after the war slavery was not a problem if not rights of the African Americans and racism was a big problem.
                at the end the North side ended up wining the war. </strong></p>
